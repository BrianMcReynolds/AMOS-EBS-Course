This directory contains the correlations between stars seen on the Gen3 and
Gen4 camera and the Gaia DR2 star catalog.  There is one file per camera
per night, and the file names are like
	gXstarYYYY-MM-DD.csv
where
	X is 3 or 4 for Gen3 or Gen4
	YYYY is the UT year of the night
	MM is the UT month of the night
	DD is the UT day of the night

The columns of the CSV file are
	(1) UT date string YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss when the camera clock t=0
		YYYY, MM, DD are UT year, month day
		hh, mm, ss are UT time in hour, minute, second
	(2) Microseconds of slice midpoint since t=0 (int)
	(3) Column (float; pixel)
	(4) Row (float; pixel)
	(5) Mag (float; ZP - 2.5*log10(SExtractor counts), ZP is arbitrary)
	(6) Gaia RA (double, J2000, degrees)
	(7) Gaia Dec (double, J2000, degrees)
	(8) Gaia mag (float, gaia_mag from catalog)

The correlations were obtained by making time slices of the events 5 seconds
wide, making a FITS image from the (col,row) of the + events, and submitting
that image to SExtractor to measure the star positions and fluxes.  The
brightest stars were fed to SExtractor to get the approximate mapping from
(col,row) to (RA,Dec).  Finally, the list of all star (RA,Dec) was correlated
with the Gaia catalog to provide the catalog (RA,Dec,Mag) which appear in
this file.  Note that because the catalog (RA,Dec,Mag) are included, the same
star can appear in multiple time slices as it drifts through the field of
regard.
